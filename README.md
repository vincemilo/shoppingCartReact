# Shopping Cart

Shopping cart simulation using React, React Router, and TDD via Vitest.

### Process

- Creating basic skeleton and routes and tested basic functionality navigation
- Created API call to fetch either multiple products for general product page or individual product for the individual product page as needed
- Realized I needed to move cart and item count further upstream to keep track of cart buttons on products and individual product page
- Created a clickHandler to add or update the cart appropriately
- Created custom useFetch hook to clean up product(s) components

###

- Testing of display once basic functionality is in place
- Styling
